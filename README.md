Warehouse Product Classification: Utilizing K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering to classify warehouse products based on their order counts and average weights. By standardizing the data and applying the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, we successfully categorized the products into three distinct groups. This classification enhances the efficiency of storage and inventory management, providing valuable insights for strategic warehouse operations. The results and visualizations are intended to help warehouse managers optimize space utilization and streamline product handling processes.
